        Libvirt Security Notices
        ========================

This repository records all Libvirt Security Notices that are
issued.

Notices must only added to this repository once any embargo is
lifted, since the GIT repository is fully public.

Notices are written in XML in a file "notices/$YEAR/$NUM.xml"
eg notices/2014/0001.xml. Assign numbers incrementally as
new issues are reported.  More details on the XML format can
be found in "docs/schema.txt".

When a new notice is published for the first time, send the
text rendering of the notice to the libvirt-announce@redhat.com
mailing list.

When backporting security fixes to -maint branches, update the
notice with details of the backported changeset hash.

When doing a formal maint release, update the notices included
with the release tag name.

The website is regenerated automatically from the contents of
this GIT repository on an hourly basis. Type 'make' to do a
